{"body":"\n\nAt the start of every session, we try to think of times when we used one of the techniques from the club in our work.\n\nThese are a few of those:\n\n- Helping people improve interview technique - by using the code club reading technique instead of white board for shared code reading exercise.\n- Decisions about order of items - in writing code.\n- Telling people it is amazing!\n- Makes me think about comments more.\n- Beginners think more about features and less about keywords whereas I think about keywords, not what they are doing.\n- Increased my confidence of reading python (beginner).\n- Crazy that we used to learn by reading lines.\n- Making my comments less noisy - not new but a visual reminder of what that can do to a codebase.\n- Doing refactoring by looking at the core functionality - similar to the exercise where we identify important lines.\n- I have to read and analyse 2 unfamiliar codebases in Java (not a language I use). I would have been apprehensive about this, but now I'm looking forward to it instead because of experience in code reading club. It'll be like a private code reading session.\n- Googling for alternative solutions, I found myself underlining!\n- I did actually take a pdf of the main controller & highlighted over a cup of tea. I could have just tried loads of different inputs and checked what happened, but instead, I made the effort to not just fiddle and look at output.\n","staticData":{}}
