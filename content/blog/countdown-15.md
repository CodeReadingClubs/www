## Countdown - Snippet 15

Today, a snippet in APL!

**Snippet**

![CRCRC-15](/images/articles/CRCRC-15.png)

**Snippet in text**

```apl
V←3 1 9 1 5 12 7 9 18 135
⍋V
```

**Question**

APL's grade up (⍋) operation can be used to sort. What does its output mean and how can it be used to sort value?

To make it easier we are providing the output of the above code here:

**Output**

```
2 4 1 5 7 3 8 6 9 10
```

Bonus: write the APL code that does the sorting.
